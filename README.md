## Helgrind RPG Initial Commit
### Vague Goals and Project Ideas
- Use github
    - Use github projects for tracking large scale changes (like features in JIRA)
    - You made a project called "Helgrind TTRPG Initial Population" to initiate the project
        - Create some issues for that project!
    - Use milestones!
- Use JSON for data storage
    - JSON support for at least the following:
        - Full character sheet
        - Individual talents
        - Individual sorceries/incantations/techniques
        - Schemas to validate all of these things
    - Script(s) to automate the process of validating/editing/updating all of these things
        - Unittests for the scripts


## TODO
